Don't try this yourself but this is what the old fashioned way is - done in some villages in other parts of the world.. . The guy who dismantles, wears a mask with holes at the eyes so he can see, carries a big sack with burning coals in it.  He also wraps his hands with thick cloths, carries an empty bag to collect the honey in it.. He then collects the honey in the empty bag, pulls the hive into the bag of coals.. . If he just wants to collect the honey, he would leave after collecting the honey - but the bag of coals is used to choke & burn the bees if he wanted to get rid of the hive.. . That's a bit like coding in COBOL & assembly :)
