There are the two reasons mentioned already - using the energy from the breaks and using the gas engine only when it can work efficiently.. . One more thing to note is that for several cars, the hybrid model of a car has a smaller gas engine than the regular models (e.g. for Honda Civic the gas engine for the hybrid model is 1.3L, which is not available in the regular models). So even without the other things, this engine will get better gas mileage than the larger engines.
